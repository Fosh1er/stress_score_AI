# stress_score_AI
# This project was created using open source libraries. Data for this model must include 4 medical parametres divided into 8 channels : ECG, FPG, FPG-diff, SGR, EEG (Fz-A1_L, Pz-A2_R, F3-F4, C3-C4).
# The main purpose of this model is to provide the intedrated score of stress, based on thje human's physiologic data collected during the concrete procedure. The refference to the model is 5 questionnaries (A scale for assessing the severity of a psychophysiological reaction to stress, Beck Hopelessness Scale, BHS, Mississippi Scale, The PTSD screening questionnaire, STAI). In this repository there are 2 versions of the model: first version is using Random Forest(RN) but due to the low amount of participants is likely to overeducate. and the second one is using the CNN methods, but still in progress
